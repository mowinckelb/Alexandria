# Alexandria: Agent Suggestions Log

This file contains architectural suggestions from AI agents. Human review is required before promoting changes to `ALEXANDRIA_CONTEXT.md`.

## How This Works

1. **Agents:** When you identify a potential improvement, pattern, or issue, add it below with your reasoning
2. **Humans:** Review suggestions periodically and either:
   - Promote to `ALEXANDRIA_CONTEXT.md` (delete from here after)
   - Reject with reason (mark as rejected)
   - Defer (leave for future consideration)

## Format

```markdown
### [DATE] - [CATEGORY]
**Suggested by:** [Agent type - e.g., "Cursor Agent (Claude Opus)"]
**Status:** Pending | Accepted | Rejected | Deferred
**Affects:** [Which section of ALEXANDRIA_CONTEXT.md]

**Suggestion:**

**Reasoning:**
[Why this matters]

**Human Review:**

```
